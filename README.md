# PyBank Challenge

For this challenge, I have created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of an imaginary company. The company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple and are composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses (budget_data.csv).

To perform a comprehensive financial analysis, I have calculated each of the following:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset
2. The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
3. The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

# PyPoll Challenge

In this challenge, I am tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. (Up until now, Uncle Cleetus had been trustfully tallying them one-by-one, but unfortunately, his concentration isn't what it used to be.)

The dataset for this challenge (election_data.csv) is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. Using Python script, I have calculated each of the following:

1. The total number of votes cast
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
2. The percentage of votes each candidate won
3. The total number of votes each candidate won
4. The winner of the election based on popular vote.
